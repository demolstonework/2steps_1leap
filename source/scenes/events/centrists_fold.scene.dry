= Centrists concede

Seeing the worsening economic situation in Germany, the rising threat of the Nazis, the declining influence of Social Democracy, and the increasing dissent within the party, Rudolf Hilferding has folded and agreed that, while the Great Depression is an inevitable and periodic crisis of capitalism, this does not preclude measures to ease the burden of it upon the working class or begin a move towards socialism.

- @reformist_plan: The Center backs the Reformist plan.
- @left_plan: The Center backs the Left plan.
- @center_plan: The Center comes with its own plan.

on-arrival: left_dissent += 5; left_strength -= 5; reformist_strength += 10; reformist_dissent -= 5; center_dissent -= 5; labor_dissent -= 2; moderate_plan_support += 1

The Centrists have backed the Reformist economic plan for public works and job-creation without deficit spending. This has increased support for the plan within the party and will make it an easier idea to swallow for the rest of the party, though the Left remains opposed.

@left_plan
view-if: left_strength >= reformist_strength and left_strength >= center_strength
choose-if: left_strength >= reformist_strength
on-arrival: reformist_dissent += 5; reformist_strength -= 5; left_strength += 10; left_dissent -= 5; center_dissent -= 5; labor_dissent -= 2; nationalization_support += 1

The Centrists have backed the Left economic plan for large-scale nationalizations of key and idle industries. This has increased support for the plan within the party and will make it an easier idea to swallow for the rest of the party, though the Reformists remain opposed.

@center_plan
view-if: center_strength >= left_strength and center_strength >= reformist_strength
choose-if: center_strength >= left_strength and center_strength >= reformist_strength
on-arrival: center_strength += 5; center_dissent -= 10; centrist_reform +=1;

The Centrists have created a plan which would, by unity of the international working parties would fix the crisis.
